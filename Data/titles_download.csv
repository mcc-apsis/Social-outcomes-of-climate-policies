In Post-Soviet countries such as Belarus, revenues from an industrial tariff on electricity are used to cross-subsidize heating for households. We analyze the distributional impacts of cross-subsidy reform with both input output methods and a calibrated static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with heterogeneous households based on a household consumption survey. On average, GDP gains of roughly a quarter of a percent are computed across model runs which reduce taxes and subsidies from cross-subsidization. Reducing household heating subsidy rates equally across income groups is found to be regressive. Poorer households are overly-burdened due to higher heating expenditures while richer households enjoy gains from cheaper market prices for goods. The GDP gains are even larger when the tax rates are structured to create a distributionally-neutral reform. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Sociologists and behavioural scientists recognize the importance of selecting environmental policies that have broad political support, while economists tend to compare different instruments first on the basis of their efficiency, and then by assessing their distributional impacts and thus their political acceptability. This paper examines case-study and empirical evidence that the job losses ascribed (correctly or incorrectly) to climate policies have substantial impacts on the willingness of affected workers to support these policies. In aggregate, the costs of these losses are significantly smaller than the benefits, both in terms of health and, probably, of labour market outcomes, but the losses are concentrated in specific areas, sectors and social groups that have been hit hard by the great recession and international competition. Localized contextual effects, such as peer group pressure, and politico-economic factors, such as weakened unions and tightened government budgets, amplify the strength and the persistence of the 'job-killing' argument. Compensating for the effects of climate policies on 'left-behind' workers appears to be the key priority to increase the political acceptability of such policies, but the design of compensatory policies poses serious challenges.

Energy efficiency improvements of homes may benefit health and access to affordable energy, yet better knowledge about contextual mechanisms and household practices is needed for the development of effective programs. This paper presents a mixed methods evaluation of a quasi-randomised controlled retrofit trial targeting low-income older householders. Socio-technical systems thinking offered a useful approach to explore the construct of the engineering-dominated concept of residential energy efficiency in combination with the people-focused experience of housing and health. The study combined a phenomenological enquiry into householder practices with quantitative analyses to explain health, energy cost, temperature and psycho-social outcomes for winter. The findings showed that small retrofits may mitigate the growing energy demands of this ageing population group, provide better comfort and reduce energy costs, but that the effectiveness of the retrofits was reduced by socially shared heating and ventilation practices that contradicted engineering assumptions, the physiological capabilities of the householder and the modes of energy bill payments. A program that is framed around caring and safety and combines retrofits, tariff optimisations and householder practices could provide equitable climate change mitigation outcomes and co-benefits for health for this population group. The paper concludes with implications for the integration of equity and health as goals into low carbon transitions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

Focusing on the distributional impacts of energy taxes is too narrow a framework. The United States relies much more heavily on regulation than taxation to address energy-related market failures. It argues that most regulatory policies and tax subsidies to achieve energy policy goals are regressive. This includes fuel economy standards, EV purchase incentives, and energy efficiency tax incentives. In contrast, a carbon tax is likely to be progressive, even when ignoring the use of revenue. The view that carbon taxes are regressive stems from an incomplete distributional analysis that assumes all impacts arise from increases in the costs of consumer goods and services. Recent analyses have emphasized the importance of impacts on sources of income. In particular, a carbon tax is likely to reduce returns to capital more than wages. With capital disproportionately held by higher income households, this differential factor income effect is progressive. In addition, transfer income, more important for lower income households, tends to be indexed and so contributes to a carbon tax's progressivity. How carbon tax revenue is used can add even greater progressivity to a carbon tax reform. © 2019
1948566;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2018.11.004;Gender, culture and energy transitions in rural Africa;"Johnson, O.W.; <br>Gerber, V.; <br>Muhoza, C.";2019;Research over the past two decades on links between energy, gender and development suggests that greater inclusion of gender concerns in energy sector decision-making improves development outcomes. In practice, this has typically led to gendered energy approaches that focus more on technological fixes rather than providing appropriate energy services, and on meeting women's immediate needs rather than addressing the broader cultural, socio-economic and political contexts important for attaining genuine gender equity. In this paper, we take a systems perspective to explore gender issues in the context of a transition from traditional to modern energy services, such as lighting, powering appliances and charging mobile phones. Viewing gender through the lens of the Energy Cultures Framework, we analyse the case of the Mpanta solar mini-grid in rural northern Zambia. We find that the transition to more modern energy services is far from gender neutral: despite providing broad benefits within the community, the benefits derived from a new technology and service were not evenly distributed between men and women due to broader socio-cultural practices and norms. This paper extends the application of the Energy Cultures Framework in two important ways. Firstly, it incorporates an explicit gender dimension into the framework. Secondly, it applies the framework in a new context – rural energy transitions in low-income countries. In doing so, this paper offers important insights for research and practice in energy, gender and development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Although negative effects on household welfare and related poverty measures are widely discussed as possible consequences, empirical evidence is missing. We try to fill this gap by simulating an input-output model coupled with household survey data to examine the welfare effects of different carbon tax rates over the income distribution. The currently effective tax rate is small and has negligible effects on household welfare. Higher simulated tax rates, maintaining the current tax base, show a slight progressivity but welfare losses remain moderate. Welfare losses, regressivity and poverty rise more with widening the tax base towards natural gas and the other greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) mainly through food price increases. For a complete analysis of the policy, we simulate a redistribution of calculated tax revenues and find that the resulting effects become highly progressive, also for high rates, wider tax bases and even in the absence of perfect targeting of social welfare programs.

As such, several energy-related initiatives have, in recent years, been promoted including the Community Energy Saving Programme. In this study, we explore how patterns of user consumption as influenced by occupant awareness and behaviour, can both positively and negatively influence policy initiative delivery. In so doing, we present the results from an extensive pre- and post-retrofit home energy use and performance survey of 150 properties located in Nottingham's Aspley ward, home of one of England's pilot CESP schemes. Our results show that whilst this specific initiative significantly improved home conditions and reduced energy consumption, it failed to achieve the predicted £300 annual savings on household energy bills. This was found to be largely attributed to occupants’ ingrained habits towards household energy use, higher comfort level preferences, (lack of) energy consumption awareness, and insufficient information provided to help residents better manage their home energy use following the retrofit. By exploring some of the core lessons learned from the survey, this research seeks to inform and improve the uptake and delivery of future retrofit initiatives. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Ultimately, the Navajo Nation rejected Navajo Green Jobs and re-appropriated its temporal language in order to justify a reinvestment in coal in the form of a new energy company, NTEC.

In 2016, 6.7 million Peruvians were living in rural areas. The Fondo de Inclusion Social Energetico (FISE) LPG Promotion Program, which began in 2012 and is housed under the Ministry of Energy and Mining, is a government-sponsored initiative aimed at reducing use of solid fuels by increasing access to clean fuel for cooking to poor Peruvian households. Methods: We conducted a mixed methods study incorporating data from publicly available records and reports, a community survey of 375 households in Puno (the province with the largest number of FISE beneficiary households), and in-depth interviews with community members and key stakeholders. We used the Reach, Effectiveness - Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to guide our data collection and analysis efforts. In a sample of 95 households, we also measured 48-hour area concentrations and personal exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Results: The FISE LPG promotion program has achieved high geographical reach; the program is currently serving households in 100% of districts in Peru. Households with access to electricity may be participating at a higher level than households without electricity because the program is implemented primarily by electricity distributors. In a sample of 95 households, FISE beneficiaries experienced a reduction in kitchen concentrations of PM2.5; however, there were no differences in personal exposures, and both kitchen and personal exposures were above the WHO intermediate target for indoor air quality. Among the 375 households surveyed, stove stacking with biomass fuels was reported in >95% of both beneficiary and non-beneficiary households, with fewer than 5% reporting exclusive use. In-depth interviews suggest that the complexity of the enrollment process and access to LPG distribution points may be key barriers to participating in FISE. Conclusion: The FISE LPG Program has achieved high reach and its targeted subsidy and surcharge-based financing structure represent a potentially feasible and sustainable model for other government programs. However, the prevalence of stove stacking among FISE beneficiaries remains high. There is a need for improved communication channels between program implementers and beneficiaries. FISE should also consider expanding the mobile LPG network and community delivery service to reduce physical barriers and indirect costs of LPG acquisition. Finally, increasing the value of LPG vouchers to completely cover one or two tanks a month, or alternatively, introducing behavior change strategies to reduce monthly LPG usage, may facilitate the transition to exclusive LPG use.

Using multi-dimensional poverty index and deprivation score derived from a panel dataset of household surveys and appropriate econometric models, this paper evaluates the program impact on both participating decision and its intended targets. Our results show that the risks encountered by households have a push effect on the resettlement decision, while the opportunities households obtained have a pull effect. Also, farmers who are risk takers are more likely to take part, and the government supports for relocation and skill training have significant effect on the decision. Further, the program has significantly reduced the number of dimensions of households in poverty and the living condition of resettled households and the local environment have been much improved. However, reduction in the deprivation score is not so obvious yet, and the increase of household net income remains small. Important policy implications to and recommendations for this program and other similar policies in and outside of China can be drawn from this study.

This article offers a perspective on energy policy reform and its implications for energy infrastructure in the GCC. It outlines an observed paradigm change in the rentier social contract where energy subsidies - as the key instruments of rent transfer - are been gradually replaced by a premium associated with state-provided jobs. The new paradigm allows efficient and effective distribution of rent to the growing higher-income national population while mitigating the substantial opportunity cost associated with energy subsidies. The paradigm change is being facilitated by the extension of state control from the oil sector to the non-oil energy sector. The article discusses the theoretical implications of the paradigm change and the near-term institutional setting of energy infrastructure development in the GCC.

Overcoming these barriers will require strategies that account for extremely low levels of income, lack of access to finance, poor awareness of alternative energy technologies and deficient post-installation service on solar home systems (SHSs). Our study is novel in examining reasons accounting for the slow adoption of SHSs in rural areas from the perspective of a rural (Grameen) bank. We reveal current government energy policies especially SHS subsidy scheme, largely exclude those below the poverty line. This self-induced socioeconomic barrier, in turn, limits the involvement of the banking sector who report additional barriers including higher lending costs and financial risks coupled with internally restrictive lending practices. We propose a revised framework the Rural Energy Transformation through Pro-Poor Subsidy to support an SHS capital subsidy scheme which specifically includes below poverty line households, and incorporates an electronic subsidy disbursement mechanism designed to improve efficiency and effective delivery between five key actors. These include the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, the Regional Rural Banks and suppliers deploying and maintaining subsidised SHS and the rural households. The framework would establish a contractual partnership between banks and suppliers, and at a policy level would require the government to mandate banks to lend at low margins and offer dedicated subsidy benefits to low-income populations to enable a rural energy transformation.

Most recently, the three metrics show an increase of economic inequality of at least 0.67% when accounting for network charges. This finding is due to (1) the relative inferiority of electricity, (2) the regressive impact of a fixed component of network charges, (3) considerable regional disparities, and (4) the higher prevalence of prosumers within high-income households. © 2018, Econjournals.

The analysis is based on a computable general equilibrium model with multiple households and a detailed power generation sector. It is found that using additional government revenues from higher domestic gas prices to increase the income of low- and middle-income households could improve the welfare of these households and alleviate income inequality in Russia, e.g., total private consumption of the poorest decile could increase by 3%. Nevertheless, the most efficient revenue-recycling policy would be to invest in the energy efficiency of buildings, which have the largest energy savings potential in Russia. In the long term, investing in the energy efficiency of buildings could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 240 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year and increase the welfare of low- and middle-income households, e.g., total private consumption of the poorest decile increases by 1%. It is also found that increasing the regulated domestic gas price could lead to windfall profits for non-Gazprom producers. Hence, to increase government revenues, the gas-price reform could be supplemented by an increase in the capital income tax in the gas sector.

One of these distortions was the development of fuel poverty. This paper starts by giving a multi-dimensional definition of this poverty, insisting on the structural factors (accommodation, transport) that account for the energy vulnerability of households. We show that this French green check, which consisted chiefly in a monetary compensation provided, with modulation, to all households was an injudicious solution to address fuel poverty. The reason was its inadequate calibration as regards the structural dimensions of fuel poverty. Most of the new versions of the green check developed around 2010 still missed the target by ignoring some structural dimensions of fuel poverty, or by multiplying the policy goals with insufficient means. Looking back on these experiences, we contend that the main problems do not result from the green check itself, but rather from the lack of proper indicators to define and measure fuel poverty, in particular regarding its structural dimensions. Circumstantial and local public policies, as some of them are being now developed, might be useful to better delineate fuel poverty and to assess the accuracy of national-based ecological taxation in addressing these phenomena. © 2017 NSS-Dialogues, EDP Sciences.
866837;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2017.05.495;Sustainable development synergies and their ability to create coalitions for low-carbon transport measures;Lah, O.;2017;Many low-carbon transport strategies can help achieve other economic, social and environmental objectives. These include improving access to mobility, reducing traffic and parking congestion, saving consumers money, supporting economic development, increasing public health and safety, and reducing air and noise pollution. Based on Avoid-Shift-Improve approaches and case studies from Germany, Colombia, India and Singapore, this paper shows that low-carbon transport generates significant and quantifiable benefits that can create a basis for political and societal coalitions. Estimates suggest that currently available and cost effective measures can reduce transport Greenhouse Gas emissions by 40-50% compared to 2010. Yet, a number of barriers affect the optimal exploitation of this potential. Considering the possible economic, social and environmental benefits of sustainable transport, the shift towards a low-carbon pathway of this sector can be a win-win situation for climate protection and local development goals. This paper aims to make a contribution to understand these opportunities by highlighting the linkages between objectives, presenting case studies, facts and figures. The paper will also explore assessment methodologies and tools that can help practitioners to assess sustainable development benefits (SDB) and providing evidence for policy-makers to make more informed decisions on transport investments and polices. © 2017 The Authors.

By undertaking a comparative analysis of cooking fuel use patterns across two states, differentiated in terms of key economic parameters, this paper highlights policies that aimed at clean fuel switching in India need to pay attention to social groups, gender and location (rural/urban) to make clean cooking fuel policies more inclusive in order to realize the target of universal access to clean cooking energy. The analysis was carried out across expenditure categories, social groups and female-headed households. The results show wide disparity in clean cooking fuel use across the states as well as across different expenditure categories, social groups and female-headed households and geographical locations within states. The data source for the analysis is the National Sample Survey Organisation and Census.

Exploring Australian attitudes to climate and social policy;"Spies-Butcher, B; <br>Stebbing, A";2016;Despite growing evidence of significant impacts from human-induced climate change, policy responses have been slow. Understanding this policy inertia has led to competing explanations, which either point to the need to build a consensual politics separated from economic partisanship, or which encourage solidarities between environmental and social movements and issues. This article analyses a recent successful mobilisation, leading to the passage of the Clean Energy Act in Australia, to explore the relationship between attitudes to environmental and social protection, particularly among the core constituency in favour of stronger climate action. Using social survey data from the Australian Election Study, the article finds evidence of independent associations between prioritising environmental concerns and support for welfare state expansion, and a realignment of materialist and post-materialist values. This we argue is consistent with Polanyian analysis that posits a link between social and environmental causes based on resistance to commodification.
202048;http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/685597;The distributional effects of US clean energy tax credits;"Borenstein, S.; <br>Davis, L.W.";2016;Since 2006, US households have received more than $18 billion in federal income tax credits for weatherizing their homes, installing solar panels, buying hybrid and electric vehicles, and other “clean energy” investments. We use tax return data to examine the socioeconomic characteristics of program recipients. We find that these tax expenditures have gone predominantly to higher- income Americans. The bottom three income quintiles have received about 10% of all credits, while the top quintile has received about 60%. The most extreme is the program aimed at electric vehicles, where we find that the top income quintile has received about 90% of all credits. By comparing to previous work on the distributional consequences of pricing greenhouse gas emissions, we conclude that tax credits are likely to be much less attractive on distributional grounds than market mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs). © 2016 by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Payment of subsidies causes some failures in the economy, such as disrupting the price mechanism and destroying allocation of resources in the economy. Removing these subsidies has important implication for sustainable development through their effects on energy consumption, price system, resource allocation and emission. This study employs a computable general equilibrium model, which is a more comprehensive method than statistical and econometric methods, to identify the long-run impacts of energy subsidy reform in the Malaysian economy, especially on poverty and income inequality across four Malaysian ethnic groups, namely Malay, Chinese, Indian, Other in both rural and urban areas, and one noncitizen household. The results of this study indicate that urban households are set to lose most from energy subsidy reform compared to rural and noncitizen households due to increased expenditure. In addition, Malay households, particularly in urban areas, lose more significantly than other household groups. This policy leads to initial increases in the overall inequality in the economy, but the increase in inequality in urban areas is greater than rural areas.

We aim to contribute to this aspect of GE research by looking at selected country experiences of renewable energy deployment with respect to the socio-economic goals of job creation or energy access. Across the cases examined, we find the following implications of relevance for the GE framework: First, we confirm the important role of governmental action for GE, with the specific need to state objectives clearly and build monitoring capacity. Second, consistent with the ""strong"" green growth variant of GE, some of the cases suggest that while renewable deployment may indeed lead to short-term socio-economic benefits, these benefits may not last. Third, we underline the urgent need for new methodologies to analyze and better understand multiple objective policies, which are at the heart of the GE paradigm. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd."
1635523;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13147-016-0395-6;The Lander in the German energy and climate policy: Distributional issues and federal decision-making;"Monstadt, J; <br>Scheiner, S";2016;Until today, the academic and political debates on the German energy transition have primarily focused on policy activities and processes at either the national or local level. However, they have largely ignored how the Lander shape the federal decision-making on the allocation of greenhouse gas emissions according to their place-based economic interests. The starting point of this paper is the empirical evidence that effective national climate mitigation policies can go along with considerable and spatially unevenly distributed redistributive effects for regional energy industries, energy consumption sectors and thus public budgets of the Lander. Since the costs and benefits of climate mitigation policies are distributed unevenly, the Lander pursue place-based economic and political interests that shape their climate mitigation programs and their positions in federal decision-making. Based on an analysis of the regional economic interests and of the climate mitigation programs of the Lander, the paper uses the cases of the renewable energy policies and the European emission trading system to demonstrate how (re-)distributional conflicts in climate mitigation policies have been reconciled. The case studies show that redistributive policies could be implemented through concessions to single Lander. They also show that through distributive mechanisms, the externalization of costs to the users played a major role, and that the EU could partially dissolve blockades in decision-making. Contrary to findings in the academic debate on German federalism, federal climate mitigation policies have partially stimulated mechanisms for economic and innovation competition between the Lander. However, the findings also demonstrate that the concessions to regional economic interests have reduced the cost-efficiency and effectiveness of the German energy and climate mitigation policies.

What are the consequences for their employees' jobs and skills? At first sight, the impact does not appear to be dramatic, apart from the need to educate tenants about appropriate practices, in particular for local teams (including building caretakers). For the maintenance technicians, the challenge is to make adjustments to equipment characterised by poor coordination between manu-facturers, installers and maintenance companies. As for the programme leaders, they have enjoyed a period of stimulating innovation. For all these professions, however, the priorities that have emerged relate to accumulating experience and contributing to collective learning, which means that the real need is not so much for training as for organisation and management.

To this end a methodology has been developed to quantify project performance across five dimensions, each informed by three key indicators, and aggregate these into a composite indicator, using weights obtained from a survey of experts. The experience demonstrates the inherent limitations in developing a one-size-fits-all' methodology, revealing the implicit tension between the political desire to refer to objective, absolute, measures of best practice and highly contextual realities where baselines are often lacking. However, the methodology does offer a comparative means to highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses of any given project, enabling both ex-post assessments and project learning.

Also if the provision of access to energy is sustainable, i.e. via renewable energy sources, there is an added benefit of contributing to mitigation of climate change. Currently, the percentage of population with access to energy varies significantly between countries and across regions. This is due to the nature of national socio-economic situations and energy resource availability in differing settings. This article addresses issues and hindrances to energy access in regional contexts and also examines, in particular, the prospects of how regional cooperation initiatives linked with climate change mitigation objectives could assist in widening energy access. Existing relevant regional cooperation initiatives that may be upscaled or used as models to widen access to modern energy services are evaluated. Findings are that regional cooperation initiatives linked with climate change mitigation can potentially facilitate widening energy access. However, in order to realise such potential, synergies from regional cooperation that are indirectly linked to energy and wider climate change mitigation programs should be harnessed. Recommendations are made for development of sustainable energy programs in energy deprived regions that will also mitigate climate change impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Government of Pakistan is focusing on different problem areas of the sector in the successive policy papers namely, National Power Policy 1994, 1995, 1998 and 2013, Policy for Development of Renewable Energy for Power Generation, 2006 Alternative and Renewable Energy policy, 2011 (also called Mid-term renewable energy policy) specifically highlighting the importance given to Renewable Energy Technology. Bearing in mind these policy documents this paper is aimed at analyzing the prior to renewable policy reforms scenario and other supportive measures from institutional perspective that are still in the phase of formulation by the government. For the reform process, Annual Development Plans/Medium Term Development Framework and Development Outlays (PSDPs) formulated, at the National, Federal and Provincial level, with the base-line analysis provided by Economic Surveys, are of key importance. The Social Development Department of the World Bank presented a sourcebook in 2007, titled 'Tools for Institutional, Political and Social Analysis of Policy Reforms'. This sourcebook encompassed an analytical framework with a wide range of tools for the practitioners and consultants involved in policy analysis in developing countries. This paper uses the institutional tools from amongst them to analyze the policy recommendations of renewable energy. The methodology involves Meso-level (Policy Implementation) analysis with primary focus on institutional analysis that further splits into three broad dimensions namely, Static Mapping, Process Training and Process Mapping. Each of these dimensions is substantiated with relevant examples in this paper. This paper also addresses the vital question: How to make Renewable Energy Sustainable in the case of Pakistan? A plethora of literature deals directly or indirectly with this question. The highpoint of this paper is the integration of Renewable Energy Policies with Sustainable Development vision acclaimed world-wide. The ultimate findings presented in this paper accentuate that Renewable Energy policies and the resultant reforms need to be inclusive, context-based and equitable as well as efficient to have a huge and lasting distributional impact.

The implementation of that principle is monitored by a set of indicators being developed since 1995, referred to as the indicators of sustainable development. The monitoring is conducted both at the level of Member State, as well as of the entire community. The main indicators describing the social, economic and environmental issues of the EU functioning show positive results in regard to the implementation of the sustainable development strategy; however, in the themes related to the issues of social inclusion, sustainable transport, and global partnership, the indicators show a negative trend. In this paper, the sustainable development indicators in the theme of Climate change and energy are described and analyzed in detail. Their changes over the last decades were strongly stimulated by the EU energy policy. In connection with the implementation of numerous programs for the promotion of renewable energy sources, their share in the energy market is growing, whereas the greenhouse gas emissions from the EU area and the primary energy consumption are falling. During the last 25 years, the total man-made GHG emission in the EU was reduced by 18%. It should be noted that these changes are influenced not only by the manner of energy management stimulation in the EU, but also by an equally significant problem of the economic crisis, geopolitical situation, and the resulting economic change. Moreover, some indicators relevant to the concerned theme, such as energy dependency, clearly show a negative trend."

The social acceptability of Germany's energy transition towards more sustainable generation and usage of energy is frequently the subject of such critical appraisals. The discourse centres upon the burden imposed on electricity users as a result of the promotion of renewable energy sources in the electricity sector in accordance with the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). A regressive EEG surcharge is suspected of driving up energy prices unreasonably and of being socially unjust. It is also argued that high-income utility owners profit from the EEG system at the expense of low-income electricity consumers (redistribution from bottom to top). The aim of this paper is to examine the validity of these two hypotheses and to show that both exhibit substantial theoretical and empirical weaknesses, with climate and environmental policy being played off against social policy in a questionable manner. At the same time, the article points out remaining conflicts between energy policy and social policy and makes corresponding policy recommendations for their resolution, thus contributing to reconciling distributional concerns arising in the context of incentive-oriented sustainability governance.

The technological interventions were made by the Himalayan Research Group organization which helped in economic upliftment of rural poor, women empowerment and in environment protection in hill region. The major activities are Passive Solar Retrofitting (namely, Thermosyphoning Air heat Panel (TAP), Trombe Wall (TW), and Sun Spaces (SS)) fodder development, vermicompost biotechnology, button mushroom cultivation and protected cultivation for climate change mitigation and adaptations. The solar retrofits reduced estimated 4.97 tones carbon emission per household during six winter months which helped in reducing the fuel wood consumption. Improved varieties of different fodder spp. were introduced for year round green fodder availability and reduce soil erosion and reduction in tree lopping. Fodder choppers and silage preparation was popularized to contain the fodder wastage. Vermicompost biotechnology was popularized among farmers to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers for improving the quality of soil. The button mushroom cultivation was used for conversion of agriculture residue into compost making by reducing crop residue burning which increases carbon emission. Protected cultivation in local made polyhouse was popularized to generate maximum returns from small piece of land through cut flower and vegetable cultivation and by raising plant nurseries.

Its use is growing at an average of rate of 12% per annum over the past 30 years, and its cooking application is currently racing at 7% per annum. It occupies 3% space in the energy basket of the country and 8% in the oil and gas space. The 66th round of National Sample Survey reveals that only 11.5% of households in rural India use LPG as cooking fuel as against 64.5% in urban India. Census 2011 has put the number at 11.4 and 65%, respectively. In the Energy Development Index (EDI), devised by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the value for India has declined from 0.295 in 2007 to 0.294 in 2011 and that for modern cooking fuel (Kerosene and LPG) from 0.265 to 0.221. The present study analyzes the trend of household consumption and supply of LPG in conjunction with price. The study assesses the status of accessibility (of LPG and other fuels) and affordability of households for LPG, and analyzes the inter-fuel transition during the last decade. It tries to estimate the unrecovered cost of marketing LPG under the current pricing regime and examines its sustainability. The study estimates the investment required for putting up infrastructure and import facilities. The study uses time-series data pertaining to LPG consumers, quantity consumed, LPG distributors, bottling plants, and capacity. Consumption pattern is linked to macroeconomic aggregates like NNP and meaningful conclusions are drawn. Based on a primary survey, it assesses the pattern of LPG use in Indian rural households. © Springer India 2015.
892466;;Socio-economic impacts of the deployment of improved fuel efficient stoves: The ILF uganda commercialization program;"Wiedmer, D.; <br>Jouslin-de-Noray, P.; <br>Graveaud, F.; <br>Jahangiri, V.";2015;Biomass accounts for 91% of the total energy used in Uganda, but is often used unsustainably: if deforestation continues at the present rate, it could lead to the destruction of all Ugandan forests by 2050. As a consequence, wood and charcoal are becoming scarce and their price is increasing. Fuel Efficient Stoves are a way to tackle these issues by decreasing the amount of biomass used for cooking. International Lifeline Fund (ILF) has launched in 2008 the cookstove Uganda Commercialization Program in the region of Lira. The program consists in the local production of improved Fuel Efficient Stoves and their selling to households by local vendors. The socio-economic impacts of this program, both on end users and on the local economy, have been studied during a field mission conducted by ENEA Consulting in 2012. The ILF Fuel Efficient Stoves reduce the domestic consumption of charcoal and energetic expenditures. Interviews of end users confirmed that they feel safer with ILF Fuel Efficient Stoves than with previous devices. They also perceive a reduction of health problems linked to domestic air pollution and an increase in women’s free time. Users also report a positive impact on domestic life as the use of the cookstove reduces the quarrels between husbands and wives by keeping meals warm and ready. Finally, the main local economic benefit along the value chain of the project appears to be the direct creation of several long-term full-time jobs. Possible improvements of the business model will be suggested, in particular to ensure its long-term economic viability. © Author(s) 2015.

The then opposition party leader, now Prime Minister, introduced legislation to repeal the tax. Amongst the many issues being debated is that of the incidence of the tax. In this study, we explore household consumption and income changes arising from a A$23 carbon price employing a computable general equilibrium model (entitled A3E-G). The model has been calibrated using a social accounting matrix database of Australia with 10 household income groups. This carbon price generates A$6.39 billion revenue while reducing Australia's carbon emissions by 11%. The empirical evidence suggests household level impacts range from proportional to mildly progressive tax incidence. In this study, we propose four revenue recycling options to overcome any undesirable distributional effects from the carbon price. Results indicate that revenue recycling through income tax reductions and uniform lump sum transfers improves post tax income levels and welfare towards middle and high income groups. A nonuniform lump sum transferring option favors low income households. Uniform reductions in commodity tax rates are not found to be welfare improving but we find positive impacts on export competitiveness from this option.

1909061;;The Weatherization Assistance Program: Social Policy or Energy Policy and Why It Matters;Terman, JN;2015;Low-income populations spend a larger proportion of their income on energy usage and tend to live in housing stocks that consume more energy. Thus, energy efficiency is cross-cutting goal, connected to both social and energy-related concerns. One case in point is the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP): a federal program that assists low-income families through education, energy audits and retrofits. While some states have exerted considerable effort to achieve program goals, others have had lackluster results. The study results here suggest that ambitious program - measured as the proportion of home weatherizations planned that were completed - is influenced by whether states view the program as a social policy-oriented program.

Lithuania has limited quantity of indigenous energy resources and is depended from the import of energy resources, such as natural gas, petroleum and hard coal. Up to the year 2009 about 70-80% of electricity was produced from Ignalina NPP. At the end of 2009, according to the requirements of EU, Ignalina NPP was closed. Lithuania's energy dependence on the imports of fuel increased remarkably from 503% in 2009 to about 82% in 2010-2012 and considerably exceeded the EU average 54%. The share of renewable and indigenous energy sources in gross inland fuel and energy consumption increased from 14.7% in 2009 to 19.5% in 2012. About 40.4% of RES and indigenous energy belonged to households sector and 44.9% were transformed in Combined Heat and Power (CHP), and only 14.7% belonged to industry and other sectors. In article, the sustainable development of Lithuanian and European households were overviewed and recent analysis of Lithuanian households sector was carried out. Dwellings were sorted by the year of construction. Distribution of households by dwelling type and heated area was assessed. Final fuel and energy consumption and distribution by different consumer groups were shown. In 2009-2012 final fuel and energy consumption of Lithuanian households comprised about 65 PJ or 33% of all final consumption. Household's energy consumption by different energy sources was disclosed. In 2012 about 36.5% of household's energy consumption belonged to solid biofuels and about 31.7% to heat energy. Electricity consumptions of households and electricity prices for household consumers were indicated and comparisons with EU-27 countries were made. Lithuanian RES flows diagram was constructed and RES share for households was revealed. The reduction of greenhouse gases emissions in Lithuania and other European countries was indicated.

The deployment of renewable and energy efficiency projects represent a large share of the so called green jobs and help retain current levels of employment especially in countries facing the socio-economic threat of increasing unemployment rates. These effects should be taken into account during the process of energy planning, but due to difficulties in their quantification this is not always feasible. This paper utilizes the input output analysis and the adjusted earnings gain approach for assessing the employment effects associated with the implementation of energy saving interventions in the building sector, with a view to produce results that can be easily incorporated into cost benefit analyses. The proposed framework, which comprises four basic steps, namely identification of all the potential changes in employment due to energy efficiency interventions, quantification of these employment effects in physical terms, calculation of the net present value of the estimated employment effects and monetization, has been implemented for three energy efficiency interventions widely implemented in Greek buildings. The results of the analysis clearly show that the exploitation of energy saving technologies in the Greek building stock generates significant employment benefits, ranging between (sic)0.11 and 0.23 million per (sic)1 million of investment in the base case scenario and reaching the 10-24% of the energy costs savings attributed to the implementation of these interventions throughout their entire lifetime.

Impact evaluation of the LPG conversion program in Indonesia;"Andadari, RK; <br>Mulder, P; <br>Rietveld, P";2014;In low- and middle-income countries, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) can be an attractive alternative to the widespread use of traditional kerosene. Not only is LPG a relatively clean, safe and cost-effective fuel for households, its large-scale adoption also reduces the heavy burden of kerosene consumption subsidies on government budgets. Against this background, we evaluate the impact of a large government program to substitute LPG for kerosene in Indonesia. Using a household survey across urban, suburban and rural regions we find that this program was very effective in causing a large scale shift from kerosene to LPG. This shift was positively influenced by level of education, household size and household income. Contradicting the energy-ladder model, the LPG program, reinforced by an increase in the price of kerosene, led to increased stacking of fuels, including increasing consumption of both electricity and traditional biomass. In addition, our analysis shows that the LPG program failed to substantially reduce the overall number of energy-poor people, but it has been effective in alleviating extreme energy-poverty. Finally, we find that medium and higher income households in suburban areas benefitted most from the LPG program. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper considers distributional implications of the RET for different energy users. Using time-series regression, we show that the increasing amount of wind energy has placed considerable downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices through the so-called merit order effect. On the other hand, RET costs are passed on to consumers in the form of retail electricity price premiums. Our findings highlight likely significant redistributive transfers between different energy user classes under current RET arrangements. In particular, some energy-intensive industries are benefiting from lower wholesale electricity prices whilst being largely exempted from contributing to the costs of the scheme. By contrast, many households are paying significant RET pass through costs whilst not necessarily benefiting from lower wholesale prices. A more equitable distribution of RET costs and benefits could be achieved by reviewing the scope and extent of industry exemptions and ensuring that methodologies to estimate wholesale price components in regulated electricity tariffs reflect more closely actual market conditions. More generally, these findings support the growing international appreciation that policy makers need to integrate distributional assessments into policy design and implementation.

1689413;;ENERGY ACCESS AND HOUSEHOLD RISK TRANSITIONS IN SOUTH AFRICA;"Kimemia, DK; <br>Annegarn, HJ";2014;Despite the commendable success in household electrification, energy poverty is still a challenge in South Africa [1], with many residents of low-income settlements unable either to afford or to access modern energy carriers. Energy related accidents such as shack fires and paraffin poisonings are a common phenomenon amongst poor communities, resulting in health and economic losses. This paper reports on two research projects that studied environmental risk transitions vis-A-vis energy poverty and the progress made in promoting modern energy access in South Africa. In the first project, the premise that energy poverty is a major determinant of energy incidents is tested with nationally representative household energy consumption surveys and hospital treatment data through quantitative analysis. The second project evaluated the impacts of an LPG intervention programme as a proxy for progress in modern energy access. Results indicate a positive non-linear relationship between poverty on one hand and the risk of injury from household energy use. The apparent household risk is generally much larger amongst non-electrified households, especially those using a combination of paraffin and candles. Results show that access to LPG reduces energy expenditure and improves overall wellbeing of households. Policy interventions arising from these findings include a need for promotion of programmes that raise awareness of domestic energy safety issues within vulnerable communities, and national energy interventions to substitute paraffin with cleaner safer modern fuels.

Costs are passed through to households by a surcharge per kilowatt hour. This effectively leads to high cost burdens for poorer households relative to wealthier ones. The authors discuss the issue from the perspective of social justice and argue that costs are distributed in an unfair manner. In the light of the rising costs of renewable energy promotion, affordability of energy among the poorest should receive increasing attention. Measures of fuel poverty and deprivation with respect to energy could serve as adequate ex-post indicators of non-affordability and should be considered in Germany. © 2014 ZBW and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper includes a review of the policy literature, document reviews, and interviews with administrators, employers, educators, workforce officials. The literature presumes green jobs training will help create jobs and that these jobs will provide opportunities for the poor. This study examined these propositions within the context of the ETPs. Findings: Stakeholders faced challenges related to a misaligned infrastructure, lack of synchronization in the labour market, and workforce gaps. They responded by coordinating available resources in innovative ways. Though many policy propositions were confirmed, the premise that green jobs are a pathway of poverty was not. Entry requirements were high and programmes lacked funds for long-term education. Research limitations/implications: Because the sample was small and little was known about the nature of emerging jobs, more research is needed on green jobs and their skill requirements. Practical implications: The study found that coordination on the policy and programme levels helped stakeholders respond to challenges. Also, new opportunities for the poor may be realized by embedding short-term training in a broad continuum of education and strategically linking both to economic development activities. Originality/value: Little is known about how training aligns with emerging industries. This study helped fill this gap by examining how stakeholders responded to the demands of the green sector. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

NZ has a poor history of housing regulation, so existing houses are often poorly insulated and rental properties are not required to have insulation or heating. Average indoor temperatures are cold by international standards and occupants regularly report they are cold, because they cannot afford to heat their houses. Fuel poverty is thought to be a factor in NZ's high rate of excess winter mortality (16%, about 1600 deaths a year) and excess winter hospitalisations (8%). We examined the link between indoor cold and health in two community trials, the Housing, Insulation, and Health Study and the Housing. Heating, and Health Study and both interventions demonstrated encouraging benefit/cost ratios. NZ governments have translated this and other research into major policy programmes designed to retrofit insulation and efficient heating into existing houses. However, houses are predominantly electrical resistance heated and a largely unregulated electricity market has seen rapidly rising residential electricity prices. These rising energy prices, combined with low rates of economic growth, rising unemployment and generally rising income inequality, are likely to further increase levels of fuel poverty in NZ, unless broader policy action is taken.

However, the distributional benefits to the 160 million households that use kerosene are not well understood. In this paper, the kerosene subsidy is formally assessed as an instrument of income redistribution. The subsidy incidence, progressivity and efficacy of the kerosene subsidy are calculated for the state of Maharashtra, under actual and ideal implementation conditions. The analysis shows that kerosene subsidies are regressive and of minimal financial value to poor rural households. This is in part because household quotas are based on cooking needs, but kerosene is used predominantly for lighting. In urban areas, subsidies are progressive, and provide benefits of up to 5 to 10% of household expenditure among poorer households which lack affordable access to LPG and biomass. Overall, only 26% of the total subsidy value directly reaches households. This analysis suggests that subsidies targeted only to kerosene-dependent urban areas would have a higher efficacy than broad-based subsidies. (C) 2012 International Energy Initiative.

692558;;Universal and sustainable access to modern energy services in rural India: An overview of policy-programmatic interventions and implications for sustainable development;Balachandra, P.;2012;India's energy challenges are accentuated by the presence of large section of the population, especially in rural areas, lacking access to modern energy carriers. Lack of access to modern energy carrier-based services has implications for economic, social and environmental wellbeing of humanity. The implications are typically in the form of income poverty, primitive lifestyles, loss of dignity, physical hardship, health hazards, lack of employment and polluted environment. In 2007, for example in India, out of a population of about 1,125 million, 400 million were without access to electricity and 801 million were depending on solid fuels for cooking. This status indicates that the polices initiated, and the programmes implemented by the government of India as well as various state governments since the past several years have proved to be ineffective. Keeping these in mind, in this paper, an attempt has been made to provide deeper insights into the relationships between energy access status, policies and programmes and sustainable development by adopting a review methodology. In essence, the paper tries to analyse the linkage- current energy access status is an outcome of policy failure, and it has given rise to negative implications for sustainable development-through a synthesis of research papers and policy documents. © Indian Institute of Science.

It takes the example of current policies in the UK as its primary focus. Methodology/approach – A combination of literature, policy review and the quantitative and qualitative evidence gathered through primary fieldwork research from a number of related studies. Findings – It is identified that different social groups can experience very different outcomes in accessing transport and adapting to changes to the transport system, whether these are uniquely targeted towards certain individuals or more systemically applied across the whole population. For this reason, it is essential that policy makers fully understand the potential vulnerability and resilience of different social groups to policies that are intended to address transport-related climate change. The key component of social impacts should be systematically analyzed, by income, potential vulnerability and their spatial and temporal distribution, as well as according to resilience/adaptability to the proposed intervention. This continues to pose an important future challenge for research in this area of transport policy making.

The past decades have witnessed a number of renewable energy developments across the world. Even though these developments are not issue-free, it is generally recognized that the benefits outweigh disadvantages. However, there is an increasing level of concern on the high initial cost associated with the renewable energies, which was claimed as one of critical barriers to the promotion of its further developments. A case study approach is adopted in this study to investigate the pricing and affordability issues associated with the renewable energy in China. The policy framework and related statistics are critically reviewed in order to discuss these issues from different stakeholders' perspective in Shandong province, China. It is concluded that the affordability remains a critical issue despite numerous efforts have been made by the Chinese Government and Shandong Provincial Government on renewable power pricing.

This paper presents a review of the trends, policies, plans and programmes for increasing energy access in Ghana with primary focus on electricity, cooking fuels and renewable energy. The paper argues that even though governments over the years have had the provision of energy services high on the national development agenda, past and existing policies and plans have not delivered effective results to accelerate energy access, especially in the rural and pen-urban areas where the services are badly needed. The paper therefore calls for a coherent national energy policy with inputs from a wider section of the public that has precise targets and clearly laid down strategies, including financing mechanisms to achieve the targets.

Home energy efficiency was measured through Standardised Assessment Procedure (SAP) ratings in each year of the trial. The trial group received an energy efficiency intervention package in year three, and the control group in year four. Year three room temperature data for a sub-sample of 100 households were obtained. A comparison group of households not living in fuel poverty were also surveyed in all four years of the study. The intervention improved SAP ratings by 12 points, generating room temperature increases of about one degree Celsius. Families did not respond to energy efficiency gains by reducing their heating expenditure. The intervention generated improvements in satisfaction with household warmth. Its receipt was not associated with gains in self-reported health. However, modest correlations between room temperatures and better social functioning, as measured by the SF36, was found.

Yet, the provision of rural energy to isolated communities might not achieve the desired long-term result unless its development is part of wider national policy geared to sustainable development and social equity. This article shows how a combination of technology and policy targeted at the improvement of livelihoods in rural areas is the best solution for maximising the capacity of renewable energy to deliver services. It pinpoints the transforming processes and the institutions participating in the delivery of energy technology. This work draws on the Cuban experience of renewable energy technology, that country's efforts to improve quality of life for remote populations, and its pledge to promote environmental sustainability. Using a sustainable livelihoods approach, the results of a survey in a rural community are analysed in the framework of existing assets and policies. The article describes how it is not only local users who benefit from a comprehensive technical, social and environmental energy approach. The same governmental administration that promotes such services has much to gain from technology that works well, benefits the poor in remote locations and protects the environment within its larger policy promoting sustainable and egalitarian society.

Focusing on a rural community, it adds to the debate surrounding the hidden nature of rural fuel poverty. As part of the programme, energy efficiency measures, including some central heating systems, were installed in 54 homes. Surveys were conducted both pre and post intervention and analysed to assess any changes. The programme demonstrated that energy efficiency intervention can lead to improvements in health and well being, increased comfort levels in the home and a reduction in the use of health services, therefore having potential cost savings for the NHS. Some households, however, remain in fuel poverty after having full central heating installed, reflecting the significant contribution of low income on the production of fuel poverty. The article concludes by suggesting that interventions in this area require commitment from multiple sectors of society, including health professionals and local communities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Although ETR is widely accepted to be a policy with desirable effects, its implementation has been limited by problems of political acceptability. The project aimed to address the question of how to make such a policy more acceptable. It is the first study to examine in depth the thinking of members of the general public about the ETR policies and is also the first international comparative study of the thinking of ordinary business people about ETR policies. The PETRAS project methodology was based around the use of interviews and focus groups to inform the assessment of social responses to ETR policies and the development of improved designs for them. A number of issues emerged relating to awareness, trust, understanding of the purpose, visibility, incentives, regressivity.. levels of taxation. terminology, communication about ETR and the use of alternative instruments. Together with these similarities, a pattern of differences between the countries can also be seen. The final section of this paper introduces the national studies described in the following papers.

As well as the lack of awareness of ETR, attitudes towards environmental taxation appear negative. When explaining the political intentions behind ETR, attitudes seem to improve somewhat, but they still remain overall sceptical. Based on the history and the results of the PETRAS project the article will describe some of the main impediments for further development of environmental tax and ETR policies in Denmark. The article concludes that the main reason why the ETR policy has been met with such apparently low social acceptability in Denmark is that the ""green"" of the ""green"" tax reform has been somewhat oversold. On this basis it recommends the pursuit of a courageous government strategy of, openly and repeatedly, stressing the revenue purposes of environmentally related taxes over the environmental purposes in an effort to redirect public discussions towards relevant issues like the pros and cons of environmentally related taxation compared with other types of taxation and the connection between the overall tax burden and demands for government spending. Such a bold government ""confession"" to the obvious revenue purposes of the environmentally related taxes could make them, if not popular, then at least a bit more acceptable to businesses and the general public.

4827;;Distributional consequences of gasoline taxation in the United Kingdom;"Santos, G; <br>Catchesides, T; <br>Santos, G; <br>Catchesides, T";2005;This paper assesses the regressive effects of gasoline taxation in the United Kingdom. When all households are considered, middle-income households suffer most of the burden. When only car-owning households are considered, gasoline taxation is strongly regressive. Low-income households that own a car are more severely affected than high-income households because they spend a larger proportion of their income on motoring. This conclusion is similar to that of previous studies on the topic.
354977;;Canadian energy policy and the struggle for sustainable development;Bruce Doern, G.;2004;In recent years, energy policy has been increasingly linked to concepts of sustainable development. In this timely collection, editor G. Bruce Doern presents an overview of Canadian energy policy, gathering together the top Canadian scholars in the field in an examination of the twenty-year period broadly benchmarked by energy liberalization and free trade in the mid-1980s, and by Canada’s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in 2002. The contributors examine issues including electricity restructuring in the wake of the August 2003 blackout, the implications of the Bush Administration’s energy policies, energy security, northern pipelines and Aboriginal energy issues, provincial changes in energy policy, and overall federal-provincial changes in regulatory governance. They also demonstrate that, since per capita energy usage has actually increased in the past several years, sustainable development remains very much a struggle rather than an achievement. When the Kyoto Protocol and its requirements for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are factored in, the Canadian record is especially dubious in basic energy terms. Canadian Energy Policy and the Struggle for Sustainable Development is key to understanding many of the issues in Canada’s endeavour to live up to its energy-related environmental responsibilities. © University of Toronto Press Incorporated 2005.

Following a brief overview of energy and transport sector trends over the past ten years, the article discusses whether and to what extent energy policies for sustainable development have impacted on poverty reduction, energy security, equitable access to energy, and transition to a more efficient and environmentally sound energy system. The impact of policies is assessed considering that such a transition involves appropriate combinations of energy efficient technologies and usage patterns, wider use of renewable energy, and gradual induction of advanced energy technologies. The article then examines the extent to which such policies have been based on integrated assessments of the needs and priorities in economic growth, social development and environmental protection and identifies some of the main constraints and barriers hampering the implementation of energy for sustainable development. The article also examines whether decision-making processes ensure multi-stakeholder participation in policy development and support a fair sharing of commitments, responsibilities and benefits among the participating stakeholders in policy implementation. Selected case studies of policies that have made a tangible difference in promoting energy for sustainable development are outlined. Finally the article discusses the challenges facing energy for sustainable development and discusses various options to accelerate the implementation of its goals.

Against the background of these concerns, the actual socio-economic impacts of climate protection measures are discussed in this paper. It is structured as follows. First, the concept of primary and secondary effects of climate policies is introduced. Secondly, there is a discussion of financial and economic impacts of local climate policies. Finally, information is given on the consequences of such measures for local energy security and air quality. The main conclusion is that, at least in the field of climate policies, there is a huge potential for local measures that are socio-economically attractive to local communities.
363625;;Redistributive and welfare impacts of a change in the TIPP tax on motor fuels;Darbéra, R.;2001;Among the various taxes aimed at providing the treasury with revenue, the French TIPP (Taxe intérieure sur les produits pétroliers or Domestic Oil Product tax) on motor fuels is one of the most regressive. Indeed, to pay the tax, poorer households spend a greater share of their income than richer households do. As a policy instrument for reducing the negative impacts of automobile use, increasing the rate of the TIPP is inefficient as such reductions are obtained at an excessive economic cost. This paper will provide an assessment of this cost. Ideally, it would be possible to compare this cost to the benefit in terms of diminished negative impacts. However, the monetarization of this benefit raises insuperable methodological and ethical problems. For the purposes of this paper, it is sufficient to relate the economic cost of an increase in the TIPP to a physical measurement of the reduction in the negative impacts obtained. This provides a yardstick to compare different policy instruments for combating the negative impacts of the private car. The TIPP seems probably to be the worst of these instruments. © 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier Science.
1987282;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14486563.1997.10648375;Ecologically sustainable development and the better cities program;"Hundloe, T.; <br>McDonald, G.";1997;As part of the appraisal of the Building Better Cities Program, the Commonwealth conducted a multipurpose and retrospective evaluation of the 26 project program, including its contribution to the achievement of Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD). The program included projects as diverse as urban consolidation, public transport, waste treatment, housing and inner urban redevelopment. This article reports the results of that evaluation. The article defines substantive and decision-making process criteria for ESD evaluation, based largely on the National Strategy for ESD, and applies them to each of the projects. Some of the projects contribute directly to ESD objectives for example to achieve energy use efficiency through encouraging public transport and increasing urban densities or to reduce environmental pollution by better waste management. No project was judged to be negative in an ESD sense although for many of the projects the links between expected project outcomes and ESD are much more tenuous, such as “improving the quality of life”, “improving urban amenity” or enhancing the “sense of community”. All projects made a commitment to improved integration between planning agencies involved in urban management and to involving the community which are important ESD objectives. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
416855;;Social benefits of financial investment support in energy conservation policy;Haugland, T;1996;This paper examines the costs and benefits of a Norwegian energy conservation program that provided financial support for investments in energy efficiency. Participants in the program included industry, commerce, public services and households. Evaluation of the program shows that about 70% of the participants were ''free riders'' who would have invested in efficiency improvements even in the absence of the program. The economic efficiency was further reduced by economic distortions caused by taxes needed to finance the program. However, the energy savings did give environmental benefits through reduced atmospheric emissions, although this effect was somewhat diluted through a ''conservation rebound,'' where the actual reduction in energy consumption was less than the theoretical savings. The energy conservation program is also highly sensitive to assumptions about the economic lifetime of the investments.

The poor spend twice as much on fuel, as a proportion of income, and are more likely than other families to be in all-electric homes or using electricity for heating. For these reasons, carbon taxes (since this was written in August 1990, the European Commission has proposed a carbon and energy tax, which has a diluted relationship with carbon dioxide emission rates) would heavily penalise the poor, so resulting in reduced consumption. Awareness of these and other conflicts is needed so that sound environmental policies do not increase the deprivation of the poorest families.
198469;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0301-4215(93)90035-E;URBAN HOUSEHOLD ENERGY USE IN TANZANIA - PRICES, SUBSTITUTES AND POVERTY;"HOSIER, RH; <br>KIPONDYA, W";1993;This paper presents the findings of the Tanzanian Urban Household Energy Survey undertaken as part of the Tanzania Urban Energy Project. Household energy use varies by income group according to local fuel availability. Considerable differences between the marginal costs of supplying fuels and market prices paid by consumers have led to major misallocations of resources. When the results of this survey are compared to the results of the 1987 household energy survey, a significant shift by households toward kerosene and electricity away from fuel-wood, charcoal and LPG is shown to have taken place. These shifts toward modern fuels are consistent with the claims of the households in the 1990 survey, and can largely be explained by fuel prices. Finally, an assessment of the lifeline tariff and the kerosene cross-subsidy demonstrate that the latter is a more effective method of ensuring the basic energy needs of the urban and rural poor.
